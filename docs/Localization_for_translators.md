# Localization for translators

## Organisation

We are looking for one team lead per language, please. If you want to share the work in a team, that's fine, but **each language team needs to agree upon one person who will lead it and adjudicate any differences of opinion that may arise**.

Anyone interested in translating, please create an account at https://crwd.in/eddi and then PM me your username and the language(s) you support, via GitHub, Discord, Frontier Forums or CrowdIn. My username on CrowdIn is `VerticalBlank`.

The translation project itself is located at https://crowdin.com/project/eddi.

## Notes

- **NATIVE SPEAKERS ONLY PLEASE!** Goes without saying.
- Text that appears in the UI must be perfect. Text that is only spoken can be a bit more lax.
- Please try to keep any text in the UI as brief as possible, to minimize cognitive burden.
- Pro tip: take one file at a time. That way you have context and it's much less daunting.
- The file `SpeechService/Properties/Phonetics.resx` is bottom priority and  can normally be ignored completely. It contains only proper names of  people (e.g. "Edmund Mahon"), stars and constellations (e.g. "Cygni")  which are normally the same in all languages.
